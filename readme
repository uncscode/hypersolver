hyper(bolic partial differential equations)solver

help(hypersolver) for use info, etc.

---

hypersolver revolves around solving hyperbolic
partial differential equations (PDEs) of the form

∂n/∂t + ∂(fn)/∂x = ∂n/∂t + f ∂n/∂x + n ∂f/∂x = g

where

n is a property of interest,
x is an independent variable of interest,
f is speed n moves along x, and
g lumps sources and sinks

functionally, n(x; t), f(x), and g(x; t; n)

note, fn is the flux across x

contributions to expand functionality are welcome!

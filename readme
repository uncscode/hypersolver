hyper(bolic partial differential equations)solver

    hypersolver revolves around solving hyperbolic
    partial differential equations (PDEs) of the form

    ∂n/∂t + ∂(fn)/∂x = ∂n/∂t + f ∂n/∂x - n ∂f/∂x = g

    where

    n is a property of interest,
    x is an independent variable of interest,
    f is speed n moves along x, and
    g lumps sources and sinks.

    Functionally, n(x; t), f(x), and g(x; t; n).

    Note, fn is the flux across x.

    Usage:
    >>> from hypersolver import select_solver
    >>> solver = select_solver(method)
    >>> solver(n0, x, t, f, g, **kwargs)

    available methods:
        - "lax_friedrichs" (default)
        - "lax_wendroff"
